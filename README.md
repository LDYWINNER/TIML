# Welcome to the TIML!
## TIML = TIL + ML

I will put on record on what I studied about ML/DL

- [Introduction to Deep Learning](https://github.com/LDYWINNER/TIML/wiki/Introduction-to-Deep-Learning)
- [Logistic Regression as a Neural Network](https://github.com/LDYWINNER/TIML/wiki/Logistic-Regression-as-a-Neural-Network)
